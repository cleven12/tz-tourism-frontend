  "description": "The Serengeti National Park is one of the most iconic wildlife destinations on Earth, covering approximately 14,763 km² of vast savannah plains in northern Tanzania. UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, the Serengeti is synonymous with the Great Migration — the annual movement of over 1.5 million wildebeest, 200,000 zebra, and hundreds of thousands of other ungulates across the plains. The park supports some of Africa's highest densities of large carnivores including lions, leopards, cheetahs, and spotted hyenas. Over 500 bird species have been recorded.",
